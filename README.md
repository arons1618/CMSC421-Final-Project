## Evaluation of Recurrent Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory Network Using COVID-19 Data

#### 1. Problem or question that our project addresses
Time series forecasting for [Covid infection data inside of some area (US State or some other type
province)](https://www.kaggle.com/fireballbyedimyrnmom/us-counties-covid-19-dataset). We plan on modeling two different reservoir methods to compare their time series
forecasting ability on the aforementioned dataset. In doing this, we can compare and contrast their
methods to evaluate which performs better for this specific task, and make more general inferences
about what scenarios these individual models work best in.
#### 2. Hypothesis that is being tested
Comparison between an RNN and LSTM on covid-19 data to find similarities and differences
between the two.
#### 3. Motivation for the work
Covid-19 has greatly affected everyone across the world but particularly students. More insight into
how the virus operates and spreads means more educated decision making in ensuring students stay
safe and healthy.
#### 4. AI method(s) we will develop and/or evaluate
We will develop a recurrent neural network as well as a long short-term memory network to compare
against each other and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.
#### 5. Implementation language, environment or methodology
We will be using python and some of its provided packages to explore the RNN and LSTM models.
We will use datasets grabbed from the internet as input for the neural network to generate
predictions.
#### 6. Approach and methods we will use
We will create 2 models for each respective neural network and compare the outcomes of each. We
can use mean squared error to compare the predicted infections with actual test data, and from there
evaluate which model performs better.
#### 7. How we will evaluate the success of your project
The success of our project will be evaluated by our ability to construct the two different RNN and
LSTM methods. We will need to clearly define and show which method prevails in the supervised
learning of temporal sequences using our data. We will be using a time-series cross validation
method to evaluate how well each model is able to predict future data based on the presented training
data and understand the variance bias tradeoff of each model
